# Forum 

## Setup
1. Thread
2. Reply
3. User 

A. Thread is created by a user.
B. A reply belongs to a thread, and belongs to a user. 

# tinker creating threads and replies
$threads = factory(‘App\Thread’, 50)->create();
$threads->each(function($thread){ factory(‘App\Reply’, 10)->create([’thread_id’ => $thread->id]); });

## Test Driving threads
First small feature: "a user should be able to read threads." Simple enough! We'll start with a basic test, and then scaffold the necessary views to make it pass.
